## What is up

For my honours project in the final year of university I found myself needing to tackle the challenge of *continual learning* with a model-based RL method. I wrote a page about that project but figured that it wouldn't be very interesting to read so here's a game you can play instead. FYI the thing I built this on is based on [DreamerV3](https://danijar.com/project/dreamerv3/), which I think is very [sleeper](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sleeper) and underrated.

I got the idea to put a game here from the "Car Racing Dreams" demo in the OG paper of [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io/) because I thought that was cool. Also displayed below the game are the model's internal representation of the game. The model features a stochastic representation consisting of 32 categorical variables with 32 classes each combined with a discrete representation consisting of 512 variables. In order, the images are the game, stochastic state distribution, stochastic state (sample of distribution), and discrete state.

Controls are W A S D.
